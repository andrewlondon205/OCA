Access Modifiers for class Definitions

- Defining two public classes within the same java file is forbidden.
- One of the class names must match the name of the java file
- A class within a java file is not required to be public.
- The only access modifiers allowed for class definitions are: public and package-private (default)


Execution Process

A java program begins execution with its main() method. A main() method is the gateway between the startup of a Java
process, which is managed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and the beginning of the programmer's code. The JVM calls
on the underlying system to allocate memory and CPU time, access files, and so on.

Compiling and Executing a Java File

- To compile Java code, the file must have the extension .java. The name of the file must match the name of the class.
- The result is a file of bytecode by the same name, but with a .class filename extension.
- Bytecode consists of instructions that the JVM knows how to execute. Notice that we must omit the .class extension to run Zoo.
  java because the period has a reserved meaning in the JVM.
