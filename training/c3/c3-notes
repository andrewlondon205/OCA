String Pool

-   Since strings are everywhere in Java, they use up a lot of memory. In some production appli- cations, they can use up
    25â€“40 percent of the memory in the entire program. Java realizes that many strings repeat in the program and solves
    this issue by reusing common ones. The string pool, also known as the intern pool, is a location in the
    Java virtual machine (JVM) that collects all these strings.
